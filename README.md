# Parallel-concepts
This repository accompanies the Parallel Computing Concepts talk that is offered by SDSC and delivered through XSEDE, SDSC's HPC training series and other venues. It currently contains code and figures for presenting scaling data - the right way and the wrong way - and illustrating the limits on scalability imposed by Amdahl's Law. This is a work in progress and new content will be added as necessary.
